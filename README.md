# evtx-nom
EVTX log file ingestion (no Windows required) using amazing ![evtx-rs](https://github.com/omerbenamram/evtx) lib. Current target is Elasticsearch with the hope of a modular output in the future.

* ECS common schema output (ive stayed close to winlogbeat however I use lowercase field names under winlog as I feel that is in spirit of ECS better than the Camel Case in winlogbeat)
